# @skirtle/create-vue-lib

A command-line utility for scaffolding a Vite project to build a Vue-based library.

⚠️ This is currently work-in-progress. It is not yet usable.

## Thanks

This project is inspired by the official [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) scaffolding tool and wouldn't be possible without it. Many thanks to [Haoqun Jiang](https://github.com/haoqunjiang) for all the hard work he puts in to maintaining that project.
